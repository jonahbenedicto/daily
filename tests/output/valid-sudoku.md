## 📋 Today's Challenge: **Valid Sudoku**

<div align="center">

### 🧩 Problem Description

</div>

Determine if a `9 x 9` Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated **according to the following rules**:

Each row must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Each column must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

Each of the nine `3 x 3` sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits `1-9` without repetition.

**Note:**

A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.

Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** board =
<pre>[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]</pre>

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

**Input:** board =
<pre>[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]</pre>

**Output:** false

Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

**Constraints:**

`board.length == 9`

`board[i].length == 9`

`board[i][j]` is a digit `1-9` or `'.'`.
