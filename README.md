## 📋 Today's Challenge: **Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I**

<div align="center">

### 🧩 Problem Description

</div>

```
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters.

Your task is to find the **maximum** difference `diff = freq(a₁₎ - freq(a₂)` between the frequency of characters `a₁` and `a₂` in the string such that:

`a₁` has an **odd frequency** in the string.

 
`a₂` has an **even frequency** in the string.

Return this **maximum** difference.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aaaaabbc" 

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of ` 5 ` , and `'b'` has an **even frequency** of ` 2 `.

 
The maximum difference is `5 - 2 = 3`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abcabcab" 

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The character `'a'` has an **odd frequency** of ` 3 ` , and `'c'` has an **even frequency** of 2 .

 
The maximum difference is `3 - 2 = 1`.

 

**Constraints:**

`3 ≤ s.length ≤ 10^0`

 
`s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

 
`s` contains at least one character with an odd frequency and one with an even frequency.
