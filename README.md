## 📋 Today's Challenge: **Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum**

<div align="center">

### 🧩 Problem Description

</div>

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a **subsequence **of `nums` of length `k` that has the **largest** ∑.

Return* ****any** such subsequence as an integer array of length *`k`.

A **subsequence** is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [2,1,3,3], k = 2

**Output:** [3,3]

Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest ∑ of 3 + 3 = 6.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,-2,3,4], k = 3

**Output:** [-1,3,4]

Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest ∑ of -1 + 3 + 4 = 6.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,3,3], k = 2

**Output:** [3,4]

Explanation:
The subsequence has the largest ∑ of 3 + 4 = 7.
Another possible subsequence is [4, 3].

**Constraints:**

`1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 1000`

`-10⁵ ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10⁵`

`1 ≤ k ≤ nums.length`

## 💻 Starting Code (Rust)

```rust
impl Solution {
    pub fn max_subsequence(nums: Vec<i32>, k: i32) -> Vec<i32> {
        
    }
}
```
